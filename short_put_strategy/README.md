# Short Put Strategy

This project implements a Rust program that analyzes stock data and executes a short put options strategy. The short put strategy involves selling put options on stocks that are expected to remain above a certain price, allowing the seller to collect premiums while potentially acquiring the stock at a lower price.

## Overview of the Short Put Strategy

1. **Core Idea**: The short put strategy allows investors to generate income by selling put options. If the stock price remains above the strike price, the options expire worthless, and the seller keeps the premium. If the stock price falls below the strike price, the seller may be obligated to purchase the stock at the strike price, potentially acquiring it at a discount.

2. **Why People Care**: Investors use this strategy to generate income in a sideways or bullish market. It can be an effective way to acquire stocks at a lower price while also earning premiums from the options sold.

3. **One Controversy**: Critics argue that the short put strategy can expose investors to significant risks, especially in volatile markets. If the stock price drops significantly, the losses can outweigh the premiums collected.

4. **Smart Question to Ask**: How can investors effectively manage the risks associated with the short put strategy in a volatile market?

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

2. Clone the repository or download the project files.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. Run the following command to build and execute the program:

   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## Examples of Usage

- The program will analyze stock data and suggest suitable stocks for the short put strategy based on predefined criteria.
- It will calculate potential profits and risks associated with executing the short put strategy on selected stocks.

## Dependencies

This project may utilize open-source APIs for stock data retrieval. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and permissions to access the data.
